				<h2>Harvey Dent joins race for Gotham DA</h2>
				<br>

				<h4>Assistant District Attorney Harvey Dent, taking advantage of political momentum after his initial prosecutions of corrupt GPD officers, announced his candidacy for Gotham DA at the infamous Krol Projects in crime-ridden East End.</h4>

				<br>

				<p>

					"I say to Gotham today, we can make our city safe for families once again," Dent proclaimed on a cold, crisp day outside the most dangerous public housing project in the city. "With your help, I will fight with every available means against the alliance of corrupt cops and organized crime that has brought this great city to its knees," he continued. Dent named reported mob leader Sal Maroni as one of his chief targets if he is elected. </p>
					
					
					
					

					<p> Dent's entry into the race has been called "the worst kept secret in Gotham" and was widely expected.

						The Assistant DA's call for a show of support from Gotham citizens before he declared his candidacy succeeded in recent weeks, with signs, posters, and spontaneous events revealing strength for Dent in almost every neighborhood of the city. </p>
			
			<p>The race for District Attorney now is set up as perhaps the most emotional campaign in recent Gotham history, observers said. Relations between Dent and the sitting District Attorney, Roger Garcetti, have been fraying almost since the moment Dent joined the District Attorney's offic</p>
					
					<p>"Garcetti and Dent have been at each other's throats since day one," said one high-level official in City Hall. "Garcetti looks at Dent as a media-mad upstart, and Dent sees Garcetti as part of the old guard which has led Gotham into a tailspin of crime and corruption."
